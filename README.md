# SMS-Classifier

## Descripition
An SMS classifier is a system that uses machine learning algorithms to label text messages (SMS) into predefined categories. It helps automate the process of sorting messages based on their content, enabling applications like spam filtering or organizing messages into relevant folders.

## Features
- **Presence of specific keywords :** This feature identifies messages containing words or phrases commonly used in spam.
-  **Word frequency :** This feature analyzes the frequency of words in a message, with a higher frequency of known spam
-  **Length of message :** Spam messages often tend to be shorter than legitimate messages, so this feature can be helpful in identifying spam based on message length.

# Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning :**  Employs algorithms and statistical models to enable the SMS classifier to learn from data, improving its accuracy over time.
- **Feature Engineering :** Involves selecting, modifying, or creating features from the raw data to enhance the modelâ€™s predictive capabilities.
- **Text Mining :** Involves extracting valuable information and patterns from unstructured text data, aiding in the identification of relevant features for classification.
- **Natural Language Processing :** Utilizes algorithms to understand and process human language, enabling the system to analyze and classify text messages effectively.

# Programming Languages used
- **Python3 :**
